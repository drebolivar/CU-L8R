        Wow, you really clicked on the About page huh. Well...let's see. I'm a gemini, I into listening to music on vinyl, favorite youtube hobby is mechanical keyboards and lo fi office set up videos. Ummm...I'm pretty sure I licked my elbow once in high school by trying really hard, but these days I'm starting to think that either I implanted that false memory or told myself i reached the elbow when i totally didn't. Does it matter? What are memories? What is existence?
