      Wow, you really clicked on the "About" page huh? Well...let's see. I'm a
      gemini. I'm into listening to music on vinyl, favorite youtube wormholes
      involve mechanical keyboards and lo-fi office set up videos. Ummm...I'm
      pretty sure I licked my elbow once in high school by trying really hard,
      but these days I'm starting to think that either I implanted that false
      memory or told myself i reached the elbow when i totally didn't. Does it
      matter? What are memories? What is existence? Who are "we" even? Here's me
      and my dog Bucky:
